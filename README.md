# üîó URL Unshortener with Google Apps Script

This project provides a Google Apps Script that helps you **automatically unshorten (expand) shortened URLs** like `bit.ly`, `t.co`, or `tinyurl` inside a Google Sheet.

## üöÄ Features

- Automatically unshortens shortened URLs using manual redirect tracing (up to 10 hops).

- Logs processing status for each URL.
- Adds a timestamp when each URL is processed.
- Provides detailed logs via `Logger.log()` in Apps Script.
- Designed for Google Sheets with custom headers.

## üìä Sheet Setup

Use a Google Sheet with the name: `unshort`

Add **these exact headers in Row 1**:

| shortlink | unshortened | status | timestamp |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| https://bit.ly/... |             |        |           |
| https://tinyurl... |             |        |           |
